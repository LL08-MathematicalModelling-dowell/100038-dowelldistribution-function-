	Call dowelldistribution function(distribution(x=0,1,2),split)						
							
	Define split as variable 						
		Input from frontend programmer or user					
	Define distribution as variable "x"						
	if x=0						
		normal distribution is selected					
	if x=1						
		poisson distribution is selected					
	if x=2						
		Display choices for distribution -" poisson distribution,normal distribution"					
			user need to select a distribution				
							
			if normal distribution is selected,				
				nothing change will happen,everything will remain same			
			if poisson distribution is selected,				
				Specify the split for which data to be selected			
					Input from user		
					Depending on the selected split,fetch the  data from the database within the time limt		
						for eg, if one hour split in case of time is selected, then take hourly data within prescribed time limit from the database	
							
					Minimum sample size  for each subset should be atleast 30		
					if not ,prompt " sample size is not adequate"		
						Call dowellsamplingrule function()	
							
							
		Function output(distribution,split,adequacy of data,required data)
